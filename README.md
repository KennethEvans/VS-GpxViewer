# GPX Viewer

GPX Viewer is a C# Windows application that allows you to examine and edit GPS Exchange Format (GPX) files through a graphical user interface. You can open multiple files, which will be shown in a tree view. You can expand the tree to see the tracks, waypoints, and routes, and further to see their sub-elements. You can send selected files to Google Earth to view the tracks, waypoints, and routes there. You can edit by using Cut, Copy, and Paste on the elements of the tree, and you can also edit the XML directly for each element.
